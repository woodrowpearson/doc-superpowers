# Tests for the canonical Spec Status Model and its call sites.

# These are prose-consistency regression guards, not behavioural tests. Issue #12's
# defect recurred across two releases (v2.12.0 -> v2.12.3) because nothing asserted the
# template text. This suite pins the guarded language and fails if the unconditional
# phrasing returns.
